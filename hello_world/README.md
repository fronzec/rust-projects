- The main function is special, this is the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
- when you use for example `print!("")`, with `!` you are calling a Rust Macro instead of a function.
- An expression must be end with a semicolon `;`. Most lines of rust code ends with a semicolon.
- `rustc` is the Rust compiler, to compile a program we could use `rustc my_program.rs`
- to run a compiled code you can use `./my_program`, that's all
