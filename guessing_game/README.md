# Guessing game
- The standard library on rust is 'std', this contains a lot of common ans useful built-ins function, like read user input and prints them.
- For example to import the **io** library from standard library of rust, we write `use std::io;`
- `let` keyword is used to create a variable on rust, by default all variables are immutable on rust, to tell rust a variable is mutable we should use `let mut var_name`.
- In rust, you can shadow a variable using the same name, e.g when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.
- you can use `match` to compare a value with others values, it consists of arms, each arm is one match case, rust takes the given value and looks on through each arm's pattern in turn.
- The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. To break an infinite loop we must use `break;` statement, and if we want to go on next iteration we can use `continue;` statement.
